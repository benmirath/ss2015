## Tools

Beside Xcode there are some tools that will make your coding experience much easier.

* [**The Book of Shaders**](http://thebookofshaders.com) We are going to follow the chapters order of this book, also you can use the [**Shader Editor**](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/edit.html), [**Function Editor**](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/function.html) and [**Glossary**](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/glossary/) from it

* [**glslCanvas**](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas):Simple tool to load GLSL shaders on HTML Canvas using WebGL. 

* [**glslViewer**](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/glslViewer/) Live GLSL coding render for MacOS and Linux 

* [**SublimeText**](http://www.sublimetext.com/): don't need introductions. Probably one of the best free text editors. You probably one to install the following packages: DashDoc, Color Highlighter, OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and MarkdownEditing.

* [**SublimeText GlslViewer Plugin**](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/glslViewer) Sublime Text 2/3 plugin for live coding GLSL Shaders

* **Grapher**: Comes for free in your OSX distribution. This handy tool let you visualize math function

* [**Shadershop**](http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/) an interface for programming GPU shaders in the mode of a direct manipulation image editor like Photoshop. It is an experiment in leveraging the programmer’s spatial reasoning the way that coding today leverages the programmer’s symbolic reasoning.

* [**Spectrum**]: Nice color scheme tool that let you extract color palettes and insert them in your code easily.

* [**Mou**](http://mouapp.com/): is important to document well your projects. Get a nice Markdown editor like [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) or [AiWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/)
