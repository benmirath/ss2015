# Week 01

Read Uniform Chapter and complete the following exercises:

* Slow down the frequency until the color change becomes almost imperceptible.

* Speed it up until you see a single color without flickering.

* Play with the three channels (RGB) in different frequencies to get interesting patterns and behaviors.

* Figure out how to use u_mouse knowing that the values are in pixels and NOT normalized values. Move colors around

* Imagine an interesting way of changing this color pattern using u_time and u_mouse coordinates

Read “Running your shader“ Chapter and tray a shader in OF, P5 and Three.js

# Week 02

Take a look at the following table of equations made by Kynd: www.flickr.com/photos/kynd/9546075099/. See how he is combining functions and their properties to control the values between 0.0 and 1.0. Now it’s time for you to practice by replicating each one of these functions on a shader. Remember the more you practice the better your karate will be.
